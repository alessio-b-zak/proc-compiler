# proc-compiler
A compiler for the language Proc specified by Semantics with Applications by Nielson. Implemented in Haskell using Megaparsec, a fork of Parsec, a parser combinator library.

Original Brief specified that state must be a function Var -> Z however I hope in the future to revisit and use the State Monad instead
