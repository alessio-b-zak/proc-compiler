# proc-compiler
A compiler for the language Proc specified by Semantics with Applications by Nielson. Implemented in Haskell using Megaparsec, a fork of Parsec, a parser combinator library.

##TODO:
  - Fix it so that varred variables are local to scope.
  - Change it so it supports the mutual recursion scope
  - Check up on how variables behave if they haven't been previously defined.
